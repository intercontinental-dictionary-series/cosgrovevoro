# Source directory

This directory contains the "raw" source data of the dataset from which the
CLDF dataset in [`cldf/`](../cldf) is derived.


## Notes

> The number of alternatives for some items is quite large. Where there were insufficient Data columns, further entries are in the Comment column, separated by semicolons.

> The transcription makes use of an acute accent above certain consonants. Most seem to show correctly, but there may be font problems with "t + acute" and "d + acute". Please be on the lookout for this.
